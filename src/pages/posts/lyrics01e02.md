ava. Hey.

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,932
Uh, my dad's...
My dad's in the hospital.

3
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:19,103
Yeah, he had, I don't know...
I don't know what.

4
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,522
But, uh...

5
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,109
Yeah, I don't know
if he's gonna be okay.

6
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,820
It's... yeah.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,575
I don't know. I'm here with Jess.

8
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,869
We're just trying to get there.
What the...

9
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,871
Can we just find a way
around the traffic, man?

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,665
Just figure it out. Please!

11
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,801
Where's the icu?

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,744
What's the situation? Can somebody...

13
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:18,663
Excuse me.

14
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:20,164
They're working on him.

15
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,334
What is this part of the hospital?
I mean, is this the best section?

16
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,713
Uh, excuse me? Doctor, is this
the best part of the hospital?

17
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:30,091
Sorry. You know, we just,
we need to know.

18
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,927
The icu is the icu.
This is the best place for him.

19
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,735
Is this where
you would take your father?

20
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,181
I'm sorry. Can the team
have some space? Please?

21
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,326
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you
worry about the medicine,

22
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,476
not the fucking feng shui?

23
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,162
Let's let the gentleman do his job.

24
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,247
- Doctor: Thank you.
- Come on.

25
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,231
- Let's do this for dad. Come on.
- Thank you.

26
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,607
Sorry.

27
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,539
Do they know who we are?

28
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,084
- I don't know.
- Are they sandbagging us?

29
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,086
- Do they know who he is?
- I don't know.

30
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,572
- Shall we call mom?
- Shiv: What?

31
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,381
No. There's like
a million people to call.

32
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,966
She'd probably just make it
about herself, anyway.

33
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:38,260
Oh, come on. Your mom's a maniac,
she's not a monster.

34
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,155
Folks, we need you
to wait through there, please.

35
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,932
Yes. Hi. I'm sorry.
We're getting mixed messages here.

36
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,326
We have no clue what's going on.

37
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,685
We will be with you
as soon as we have an assessment.

38
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,856
Okay, well, that's not good enough.
We need to know what's happening. Now.

39
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:53,776
The socio-economic health
of multiple continents

40
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,152
is dependent on his well-being.

41
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,448
"The socio-economic health
of multiple continents"?

42
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,452
Kendall. Everyone.
We have an area we can go to.

43
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,079
They'll keep us posted.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,337
Kendall: So, look, take me through
what happened exactly.

45
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,715
Uh, I don't know, exactly.
It was weird.

46
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,931
It happened fast,
we were just sitting there...

47
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,177
Shiv: We were just talking.

48
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,263
We were talking,
shiv kind of started

49
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,057
- hard-balling dad...
- I wasn't hard-balling him.

50
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,541
A brain hemorrhage doesn't come
from some chit-chat, asshole.

51
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,188
So it's definitely a brain hemorrhage?
Is that what they said?

52
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,552
Roman: Somebody said that,
right?

53
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,334
- Somebody said hemorrhage?
- Or stroke? I...

54
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,438
- Roman: The ambulance...
- A stroke is a hemorrhage.

55
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,486
- It is?
- Yes.

56
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,890
Did someone say "hemorrhage,"
or is it just us who said it?

57
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:40,990
It could be an aneurysm.

58
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,867
Why aren't we chasing this?

59
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,076
Hlchase.

60
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,871
Connor: Hey, uh, is there any...

61
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,915
Did dad ever talk to any of you guys
about cryogenics?

62
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,084
You're insane.

63
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,379
Look, I don't want to be given
the runaround

64
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,632
by Dr. Fucking
suny purchase medical school here.

65
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,469
We need to know
who the top players are, okay?

66
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,489
Who's the top dog in this hospital?
Have you talked to dad's neurologist?

67
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,849
Kendall, stop acting like
the king of the hospital.

68
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,894
We're all trying to do our best,
so just fuck off.

69
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,062
I'm on it. Okay?

70
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,951
According to this,
it sounds like a stroke,

71
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:17,067
but it could be
an acute subdural hematoma.

72
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,487
Great. Get in there
and operate, Dr. Google.

73
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,370
Connor: He once talked
to me about cryogenics.

74
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,799
What? Wouldn't that just be typical?

75
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,051
All the other billionaires
are strolling around in new bodies,

76
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,195
but not dad, because we were

77
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,805
too embarrassed
to actually discuss it.

78
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,723
Kendall: He didn't talk to you
about cryogenics.

79
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,683
- Yes, he did, Kenny.
- You talked to him about cryogenics

80
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,185
because you're obsessed
with cryogenics.

81
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,753
- I'm not really, Kendall.
- And what he didn't tell you,

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,480
- and what I'm telling you now...
- Yes?

83
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:38,708
Is that you are an idiot.

84
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:39,965
Sticks and stones, Kenny.

85
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,011
Yeah, I know. And on
his birthday, too? It's so shitty.

86
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,894
Marianne:
So, what's happening now?

87
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,389
Are you staying at the hospital?

88
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,641
I guess.

89
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,352
I mean, I think I've got a job,
but I don't know.

90
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,438
Logan said I did, but marcia
was the only one to hear it, so...

91
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:59,568
And then he tragically,
you know, like, whatever.

92
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,820
Well, what sort ofjob?
Is it a good job?

93
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,907
I don't know. Like, could be anything.

94
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,201
And I have, like, 20 bucks left.

95
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,537
The world is so fucked up.

96
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,540
I am not sending you
any more money, Greg.

97
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,543
- Step up.
- I'm not asking you to send me...

98
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:19,922
Look, just make sure about the job.
All right?

99
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,257
- Hey.
- Yeah, I know.

100
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,800
Hey, do you have cash?

101
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,345
Yeah, uh...

102
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,683
- No, just my last $20.
- That's fine. Thanks.

103
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:42,027
Narrator: Born in humble
circumstances in dundee, Scotland,

104
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,738
shortly before the outbreak
of the second world war,

105
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,408
Logan Roy grew up in poverty,

106
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,578
but died one of the richest
and most powerful men in america.

107
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,722
His widowed mother
took the decision...

108
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,832
Kendall: It's an atn obituary.

109
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:57,418
They want us to okay it
in case they have to run it.

110
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,337
Is it nice?

111
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,841
I mean, it's made by
his own news division.

112
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,093
Doesn't say he was a prick.

113
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,137
Connor: I know you're busy. I know.

114
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,431
- You want to watch it?
- No.

115
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,726
I would really love to see you.

116
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,896
Yes, it's appropriate.
It could hardly be more appropriate.

117
00:07:18,022 --> 00:07:19,023
Okay?

118
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,567
Yeah, okay. Okay, good.

119
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,152
- Hey, Jess?
- Mmm-hmm?

120
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,323
There's nothing in here about our mom.
Or Connor's. They need to be included.

121
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,532
Yeah.

122
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,495
Um, pj says Aziz kahn at Mayo clinic
is the best there is.

123
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,831
Sarah says Ann wieman at nyu.

124
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,500
Ann wieman? Is that...
That's not who I have.

125
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,294
Well, it's the name I have.

126
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,480
Can you tell Sarah to give her a call?

127
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,505
Sure.

128
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,108
- Shiv: Hey, Roman.
- Uh, do you have regular?

129
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,133
Shiv: No, I've got...

130
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,225
Now I'm strapped.
Was there any change at all?

131
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,845
Connor: Oh, hey, you guys.
Shiv: What?

132
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,096
Could I have the change?

133
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,975
What is this? Already?
People are sending shit already?

134
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,019
It's from Lawrence yee at vaulter.

135
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:02,066
Call him and tell him
that is not fucking appreciated.

136
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,400
Jess: Mmm-hmm.

137
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,111
- Kendall, I'm so sorry.
- Thank you, Gerri.

138
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,864
Can you give me five? We need to talk.

139
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,158
Over here, okay?

140
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,127
Obviously the nominating committee,
the board, has a plan

141
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,421
in the event
of Logan's incapacitation.

142
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,341
Sorry, do I need to
hear this right now?

143
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,094
You do. In the event that we, uh,

144
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:34,181
continue on our trajectory
of his current consciousness,

145
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,141
we're gonna need to announce a plan

146
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,144
by around 6:30,
before the markets open,

147
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,522
in order to avoid
a lot of funky chowder.

148
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,816
Did you say "funky chowder"?

149
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,235
- We've set up down here.
- What have you set up?

150
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,571
Well, you're gonna want a place
to just be, and chill, you know.

151
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,033
Um, we talked to some of the trustees
of the hospital,

152
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,177
so everybody knows who's who.

153
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,246
Yeah. It's not a war room yet, but...

154
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,465
- But if we need one, it's available.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:08,882
Kendall: Jesus.

156
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,361
Uh, so, there's a bathroom
through there.

157
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,845
- Hi, karolina.
- Hi.

158
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,012
Thank you, guys.

159
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,474
So, I have dewi and asha from
the nominating committee on the line.

160
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,686
Kendall's here,
and you're on speaker, guys.

161
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,106
Dewi: So sorry to hear about the news.
Asha: Likewise.

162
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,024
As you know, our standing plan

163
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:29,486
in the event of Logan's absence,

164
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,322
Is to separate his ceo
and chairman roles.

165
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,491
Dewi: You'll become acting ceo,

166
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,618
frank stays on as coo.

167
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,121
We'll need to act fast.
Stabilize the stock price.

168
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,372
Dewi? Dewi?

169
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,207
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,461
My dad is my focus right now, okay?

171
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,796
Gerri: Of course, it's just that, um,
there's a problem

172
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,256
in terms of the optics

173
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,676
if what happened earlier today
between you two gets out.

174
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,930
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

175
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,974
Sure. Well...

176
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,565
Dewi: And then, there's
the problem with frank.

177
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,981
Logan fired him and promoted Roman.

178
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:07,483
Roman?

179
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,735
Jesus.

180
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:18,660
Look, I'm sorry,
I can't get into this right now, guys.

181
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,663
No, no, of course.
You are in no fit state.

182
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,592
But here's my take, okay?

183
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,013
My dad got sick today, right?

184
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,975
I don't know, I mean, nobody knows

185
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,144
when he started
acting out of character,

186
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:48,690
but, like, he didn't seem great
from the morning on,

187
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,568
and there's no paper
on any of the moves made today.

188
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:52,653
Right, Gerri?

189
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:54,905
Nothing meaningful.

190
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,925
Kendall: Yeah, it was words.
Words are just, what?

191
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,159
Nothing. Complicated airflow.

192
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,289
I mean, if I was saying
what actually happened today,

193
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,792
it would be nothing.

194
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,713
Well, that certainly makes things
simpler from our point of view.

195
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,841
Do you think you can get
the family behind it?

196
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,801
Yes.

197
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:16,969
And frank?

198
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,387
Sure.

199
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,106
Dude, can't we just talk here?

200
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,785
Roman: You know Connor's
invited Willa down?

201
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,778
Ugh. What? Here?
What's the deal with their deal?

202
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:38,282
Uh... unlike me, he has
no sense of boundaries.

203
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,910
- Shiv: What the fuck?
- It's stale, but it's empty, I think.

204
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,370
- Hello?
- You wanna do a play?

205
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,665
No, um, I just wanted to...

206
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,837
I've been thinking
that maybe this might be

207
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,255
really tough on marcia.

208
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,882
Yeah, you're thinking that?

209
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,593
What, will she put all her inheritance
into gold or oil?

210
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,053
No, I just... no, I...

211
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,515
Look, I know that, like,
the trust only comes into play

212
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,933
if certain things happen.

213
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,537
Shiv: Yeah, he's dead,
or brain dead.

214
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,563
Yeah, but I was thinking, like...

215
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,858
Wouldn't it be nice for dad to wake up

216
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,235
and for all of us to have signed,
like he wanted?

217
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,446
You know, like a nice gesture?

218
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:18,864
And if he doesn't wake up,

219
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:23,035
we've basically signed over to marcia
the power to choose the new dad.

220
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,832
Okay. So, for the record,

221
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,418
you are declining to sign
on the change of trust?

222
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,754
- For the record?
- Yeah.

223
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,279
What the fuck is this, mccarthyism?

224
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,840
I'm not declining, I'm just not...

225
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,676
I'm not "clining." What the...

226
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,220
Okay. No.
Okay, just, you know, that just seems

227
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,598
very shitty under the circumstances.

228
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,308
What circumstances?

229
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,435
Well, you did make
her husband's brain explode.

230
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,437
- Fuck you, man!
- Owl

231
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,856
- Fuck you...
- Wait, stop it!

232
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,524
- Stop it!
- You shit!

233
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,048
Roman: What, are you fucking insane?

234
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,615
No! No!

235
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:04,910
Shiv: Get off!

236
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,747
He doesn't deserve this.

237
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,541
It's just so unfair.

238
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,294
He's a great man.

239
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,721
He, like, let me
come to his birthday lunch.

240
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,807
And he offered me a job.

241
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,268
Right?

242
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,688
He doesn't deserve this.

243
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:37,567
And so, if there's anything
that I can do, let me know.

244
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,700
- Actually, there is something.
- Okay.

245
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:49,037
Can you go to the apartment
and get his bed things and slippers?

246
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,747
The ones with the dark checks.

247
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,499
You don't mind?

248
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,334
No, no. I'd be

249
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:59,214
respectfully, uh, somberly willing.

250
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:00,632
Thank you.

251
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:04,803
- Now?
- Please.

252
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,596
Okay. All right.

253
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,267
Marcia, we can get Colin or the driver
to go and get his things.

254
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,687
I don't need this fly
buzzing in my face.

255
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,441
Slippers, slippers, slippers,
slippers, slippers.

256
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,401
Yeah, don't fuck it up.

257
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,158
Fucking long legs. Greg!

258
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,494
- Hey, I need a favor from you.
- What's up?

259
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,830
Um, dad had some papers
he wanted us to sign,

260
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:32,974
and they're in some envelopes.

261
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,709
Just pick them up at the house,
and bring them.

262
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,420
- Yeah. Um, where are the papers?
- Yeah.

263
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,606
They're in the house somewhere.
They're just in envelopes.

264
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,983
They're just in the house. You got it?

265
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,609
- Okay. I was imagining...
- You're fucking tall.

266
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,761
This is hurting my goddamn neck.
I have to go, okay?

267
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,679
Just find the papers,
and bring them back.

268
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,306
Papers, and...
They're gonna be just...

269
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,058
I am so done with this conversation.

270
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,810
- Just handle it, okay?
- All right. Yeah.

271
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,690
Doctor: Better not fuck this one up.

272
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,485
I don't want Logan Roy's newspapers
going through my trash cans.

273
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,422
- Oh, my god! We've killed...
- Man: Logan.

274
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,924
We 're bastards!

275
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,425
Turn that off.

276
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,220
Roman, no. Turn it off.

277
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,783
- Oh, my god! We've killed...
- Logan.

278
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:30,889
We 're...

279
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,058
What are they saying?

280
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,310
Just rumors, you know.

281
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,189
He was taken to the hospital,
some of Twitter says he's dead,

282
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,274
and also a good deal

283
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,570
of rejoicing
at our father's potential demise.

284
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:49,991
Can we find out who these fuckers are
and, like, report them?

285
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,994
Or just, like, screen grab their shit.

286
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,788
- Okay.
- So we know? Yeah?

287
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,209
Connor: So, I don't know
where Kendall is, but...

288
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,877
Hi. Really sorry, you guys.

289
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,420
Thanks, Willa.

290
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,506
Why don't we sit over here.
There's Ken.

291
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,261
That's gross.

292
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,012
Roman: Hey.

293
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,682
News is out.

294
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,016
Kendall: Okay, right. Well...

295
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,938
So, um, listen.

296
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,818
I don't even want to think about this,

297
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,655
but I just spoke
to the nominating committee, and...

298
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,828
The thing is that the plan is
to announce that I take over from dad.

299
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,997
- Well, no.
- Excuse me?

300
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,582
- What do you mean?
- I mean

301
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,347
we're waiting for the results
of the scan.

302
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,626
It's a pointless conversation.

303
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,628
Okay, well, let's talk about it.

304
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,298
I can't talk about it. I'm upset.

305
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,424
Hey! I'm upset too.

306
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,759
Not too upset to go and fucking plot
with the suits.

307
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,052
Fuck you! Okay?

308
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,638
I could hardly hear them
for the blood rushing in my ears.

309
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,241
Shiv: Isn't there
a plan anyways? Like...

310
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,767
Yes, there's a plan.
That's what I'm fucking telling you.

311
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,520
The plan is that frank and I
will take over...

312
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:03,481
- Frank was fired, so...
- Shiv: Yeah.

313
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,946
Okay. Well, I mean, let's discuss,
and just see where we are, right?

314
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,198
I'm not doing this.

315
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,366
If dad dies,

316
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,036
I don't want to be talking
about this shit when he dies.

317
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,329
He won't die.

318
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,212
Greg: Yeah, this is great. Thank you.

319
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,260
Hey, man.

320
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,221
Uh, sorry, I'm really sorry,

321
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,866
but I don't have any money
for the cab.

322
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,515
I'm sorry, sir. Do I know you?

323
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:41,311
Yeah, I was here a little earlier.
I got assaulted a little in there.

324
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,605
Um, so can you pay
for the cab, please?

325
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,106
She was supposed to call,

326
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,319
but maybe she didn't because
there's an emergency happening.

327
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,197
Sir, I'm sorry,
I don't know who you are.

328
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:00,163
Okay, so he's not gonna
lend me the money.

329
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,915
So I don't know, um...

330
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,044
You know, pretty much,
he owes you your money.

331
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,629
Driver: He owes me the...

332
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,756
You better give me the money, dude.

333
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,678
You guys need to
work this out for yourselves,

334
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,265
because basically one of you guys
hasn't got $14, okay?

335
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,856
Yes, ma'am. Hello, Mrs. Roy?

336
00:18:58,847 --> 00:18:59,848
Knock-knock.

337
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:03,685
Thank you.

338
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,831
I'm so sorry.

339
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,377
It's so weird.

340
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,506
I actually like hospitals.

341
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,634
Lots of people don't,
but they're safe.

342
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:43,058
The weird thing for me
is that I was, well...

343
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,269
I'd been intending to talk to Logan,

344
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:49,856
you know, and make a proposal,

345
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,734
a very decent proposal, to shiv.

346
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,991
Actually been meaning
to ask for his blessing for a while,

347
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:03,620
but now, it's very difficult.

348
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,999
You need to find the right time
for these conversations.

349
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,125
Right.

350
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,046
The weird thing I'm thinking now is,

351
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,673
do you think Logan
would still like to be asked?

352
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,387
You know?
I mean, I know he can't reply,

353
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,391
but would he appreciate the gesture
if he was told about it later?

354
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,643
Or even in the case...

355
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,730
In the case of the worst case,

356
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,817
would it have been nice
to have asked his body?

357
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,382
Reporter: Rumors continue
to circulate about the health of...

358
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,698
Hey, hey. Uh, they're ready.

359
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,617
They have the results.

360
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,619
Okay. Fuck.

361
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,038
Is he okay?

362
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,748
Yeah. Yeah. He'll be fine.

363
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,935
He's probably in there
eating a fucking chicken bucket

364
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,043
and yelling at someone.

365
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,671
He's had a hemorrhagic stroke,

366
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,065
a bleed in the deep right hemisphere

367
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,900
that put pressure on the thalamus
and the brain stem,

368
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,764
and that's what caused
a loss of consciousness.

369
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,470
So, what, do you operate?

370
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:06,057
We don't do that with deep bleeds,
especially in older patients.

371
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,852
- He's not an older patient.
- Dude, hejust turned 80.

372
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,789
But physically, he's, like, still
in his 70s, and he's in great shape.

373
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,441
The evidence is that
operating in situations like these

374
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:15,525
isn't worthwhile.

375
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,403
So, then, what do you do?

376
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,196
You can't do nothing.

377
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,323
Well, we will carry out
regular observations,

378
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,409
and hopefully
we'll see some improvement soon.

379
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,244
That's not good enough.

380
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,079
Right, Dr. Judith? That's...

381
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,539
It's an excellent department.

382
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,459
Well, thank you for your input,

383
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,270
but you'll understand
if we check out our options.

384
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,671
My assistant's been in touch
with Ann wieman at nyu,

385
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,506
and we might move dad there.

386
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,134
No. He stays here.

387
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,136
He gets better here.

388
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,722
Well, we can discuss.

389
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,934
- We'll discuss and get back to you.
- No. No discussion.

390
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,480
I am his next of kin. I am his proxy.

391
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,483
I am in charge. Thank you.

392
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:05,617
Good. Well, we'll move Logan
to a suite in Greenberg.

393
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,869
I'll show you the way.

394
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:11,873
I'm sure you have some questions.
Feel free to ask me on the way up.

395
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,592
- I'm sorry, Ken.
- Thanks for coming over.

396
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,428
Okay, so look.

397
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,347
We don't know what's going on.

398
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,266
He could be fine, he could not.

399
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,352
Either way, he's not gonna
be back tomorrow,

400
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,354
so long story short,

401
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,190
will you carry on as coo,
step up on the board...

402
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,858
- Become acting chairman.
- Yes.

403
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,318
-No -what?

404
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,695
He fired me, Ken.

405
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,243
Look, I don't know
if he even knew what he was saying.

406
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,788
- If his brain was working.
- His brain was working fine.

407
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,624
Well, whatever else,
there's no proof, legally,

408
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,947
- that yesterday even happened.
- That's not the problem.

409
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,396
- So what's the problem?
- I don't want to be chairman.

410
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,258
I am just an attendant lord,
here to swell a scene or two.

411
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,759
What the fuck does that mean?

412
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,344
Come on, don't do that.

413
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,930
We could do great things together.

414
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,139
Frank: Mmm-hmm.

415
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:11,975
So what do you need, frank?

416
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,562
A jazillion dollars
in unmarked bitcoin.

417
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,980
I don't have a price, Ken.

418
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,566
- Frank, I don't understand.
- We'll talk.

419
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,277
There's a lot of mess
to be cleaned up, Kendall,

420
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,903
but you can do it, son.

421
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:24,988
You can.

422
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,157
And there's nothing I can say
to change your mind?

423
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,077
I'm sorry about your father.

424
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,329
And good luck, Kenny.

425
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,445
I told Greg to bring
the change of trust.

426
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:06,863
- What?
- And when he does,

427
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,406
I think we should sign it.

428
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,784
I'm not doing anything
without my lawyer present.

429
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:15,163
Okay. Well, I'm going to sign it,
I'm getting Connor to sign it.

430
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,057
It's gonna make you look
pretty fucking heartless

431
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,082
when you don't.

432
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:23,421
Don't give me a fucking scary look.
You hit me, I will fuck you up.

433
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,132
Ah.

434
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:27,592
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

435
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,678
God, you're so annoying.

436
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,138
Shut up.

437
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,667
- Hello?
- Shiv: Greg.

438
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,503
Hey. Did you find those contracts
Roman asked for?

439
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:07,215
Uh, I... yes, I got them.

440
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,551
- Oh, I think you have the wrong ones.
- Uh, okay.

441
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,471
Right. What...

442
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,682
What shall I do?

443
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,685
Look,
there's a lot of confusion.

444
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,229
'Cause if you have any doubt,
maybe you can't find them,

445
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,605
and that might be simplest.

446
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,691
But if I do, 'cause

447
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,776
I think I have the right ones here.
They have...

448
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,653
Don't bring them in.

449
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,071
Did he change his mind?

450
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:34,659
No. I'm just telling you.
Don't bring them in.

451
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:38,830
Okay. Okay. All right, I get it.

452
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:40,998
So, who's the...

453
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,209
Like, what's
the chain of command here?

454
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,961
Are you the more senior sibling?

455
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,213
Greg, it's simple.

456
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,966
This is a favor
I'd like you to do for me,

457
00:25:50,049 -->
